        Problem:
      </h2>

      <p>Effective resizing of image with content awareness (reimplementing seam carving:
        <a href="http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/" class="commit-link" target="_blank">Avidan & Shamir 07</a>)
      </p>

      <h2>Why: </h2>
      <p>
        The diversity and versatility of display devices today imposes new demands on digital media. For instance, webpage browsed
        on phones and laptops shows can automatically resize the letters and use different layout to ensure the comfortness
        for the user. While, standard image scaling is not sufficient since the contents are affected uniformly. With a smaller
        device, we better show more important content to emphasize the theme the image wants to convey. </p>

      <p>
        The effective content-aware resizing algorithm has lots of appealing applications, such as aspect ratio change, image retargeting,
        content amplification, or object removal. </p>

      <p>
        There are several proposed methods such as Scaling, Cropping, Column removal, Pixel removal or Optimal removal. Scaling preserves
        all information but it leads to unrealistic aspect ratio when only one dimension is scaled, the objects in the image
        looks uncomfortable. Cropping is such a solution when contents are centralized with well-defined shape, but it can
        not handle situations where the contents are spreaded. While column removal can preserve the irregular shape and
        details to large extends, it creates artificial incontinuity along smooth boundary. Others like Pixel removal and
        Optimal removal has no guarantee of preserving the important content and, even worse, the geometry of the image.

      <h2>Steps:</h2>

      <p>
        We are planning to do the project in the following steps. The Step 1 and Step 2 contain the main algorithm we need to finish.
        The Step 3 - Step 7 are some possible applications taken from the original Seam Carving paper. We would also like
        to try to implement other interesting applications in Step 8. If we still have time after finishing the main algorithm
        and the applications, we would try to implement the seam carving in video. We plan to implement the algorithm in
        Matlab or Python.
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>one dimension seam carving</p>

          <p>
            The one dimension seam carving is the basic content-aware resizing algorithm. This approach removes one seam in the image
            each time. The points to be removed is selected by calculating the energy function.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>two dimension seam carving</p>

          <p>
            The two dimension seam carving is basically an extension of one dimension seam carving. However, one thing that we need to
            consider is order of removing the horizontal lines and vertical lines.
          </p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>enlarge</p>

          <p>
            This application implements an image enlarging system. To enlarge an image, we need to approximate an ‘inversion’ of this
            time evolution and insert new ‘artificial’ seams to the image.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>content amplification</p>

          <p>
            Besides enlarging the size of the image, seam carving can be used to amplify the content of the image while maintain its
            size. This can be done by scaling the image first and then do a seam carving to set it back to the origin size.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Gradient image</p>

          <p>
            seam carving + poisson solver</p>

        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Object removal</p>

          <p>
            This application is an interesting idea that we want to spend more time on. The algorithm for object removal need to be done
            with a user interface. The user will draw a mask on the object to be removed. Then the we will run seam carving
            to remove the mask while maintain the change of other parts unnoticeable.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>Multi-size</p>

          <p>
            Sometimes users don't know the final size of the image. We cannot compute the resize images again and again since it is going
            to cause too much time. We need to use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>other possible applications</p>

          <p>
            We are also interested in finding and implementing other awesome ideas in the seam carving filed.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>Website demo</p>

          <p>
            We will create an interactive online tools for user to upload their own images and resize to desired dimension.
